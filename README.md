# privacy-limiter
Prevent LLMs from processing sensitive information blindly.

That’s a idea, essentially describing a **privacy-focused annotation layer** on top of LLM inputs, using **color-coded text** to:

1. **Mark sensitivity levels of different data segments**, and
2. **Interpret sentiment and intent** using a visual spectrum.

This could evolve into a **privacy limiter or pre-processor** for LLMs.

### ✅ Here's a breakdown of your concept:

#### 🔒 **Privacy Limiter with Color-Coded Input**

* **Goal:** Prevent LLMs from processing sensitive information blindly.
* **Method:** Use a color spectrum to classify text by sensitivity and sentiment before it reaches the model.

---

### 🌈 Proposed Color Spectrum

Let’s define a **dual-purpose color scheme**:

* One **axis for sensitivity**, and
* One **for sentiment** (which can be optional or overlapped).

| Color     | Sensitivity          | Sentiment (optional meaning)  |
| --------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 🔴 Red    | Highly sensitive     | Negative tone (anger, stress) |
| 🟠 Orange | Moderately sensitive | Concerned / alert             |
| 🟡 Yellow | Mildly sensitive     | Neutral / cautionary          |
| 🟢 Green  | Not sensitive        | Positive tone (trust, calm)   |
| 🔵 Blue   | Public-safe info     | Cool / factual tone           |
| 🟣 Purple | Needs review         | Ambiguous / unclear tone      |

### 🛠️ How You Could Build This

#### 1. **Pre-processing layer**

Write a script or tool that:

* Takes input text.
* Applies color-coded markup (e.g., HTML `<span style="color:red">`) based on:

  * Entity recognition (names, emails, addresses).
  * Sentiment analysis (e.g., using `TextBlob` or `VADER`).
  * Custom keywords or regular expressions.

#### 2. **Color Annotation Engine (Prototype Idea in Python)**

```python
from textblob import TextBlob

def classify_text_by_sentiment(text):
    blob = TextBlob(text)
    polarity = blob.sentiment.polarity
    
    if polarity < -0.5:
        return 'red'      # Highly sensitive or negative
    elif polarity < 0:
        return 'orange'   # Moderately sensitive
    elif polarity == 0:
        return 'yellow'   # Mildly sensitive
    elif polarity <= 0.5:
        return 'green'    # Safe and positive
    else:
        return 'blue'     # Very safe or objective

def wrap_in_color(text, color):
    return f'<span style="color:{color}">{text}</span>'

def analyze_and_colorize(text):
    sentences = text.split('.')
    result = ''
    for sentence in sentences:
        sentence = sentence.strip()
        if sentence:
            color = classify_text_by_sentiment(sentence)
            result += wrap_in_color(sentence + '.', color) + ' '
    return result.strip()

# Example
text = "I hate sharing my phone number. I enjoy working with data. My name is Roshini."
html_output = analyze_and_colorize(text)
print(html_output)
```

### 🧠 Advanced (Future Ideas)

* Train a **custom LLM wrapper** that respects these color codes.
* Use CSS classes instead of inline styles to render in apps or web UIs.
* Map colors to **data governance rules** (e.g., red = mask or redact).
* Export color-annotated logs for transparency & auditing.

### 💡 Suggestion for Your Project

Frame this as:
**"A Privacy-Aware Input Annotation Layer for Large Language Models"**

> *"Using color-coded metadata to improve sensitivity awareness and sentiment filtering before LLM inference."*

You could even pitch this as a final-year project—universities and companies would **love** the mix of ethics, NLP, and interface design.

* Build this into a web-based demo?
* Extend the color system to support named entities (PII)?
* Draft a project proposal for academic submission?
